Introduction



 Movie Recommendation Systems play a pivotal role in modern entertainment platforms, offering users personalized suggestions tailored to their preferences. These systems leverage various algorithms and techniques, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to analyze user behavior and movie attributes. By providing relevant recommendations, they enhance the entertainment experience, increase user engagement, and drive platform satisfaction.


 
IMPORTANCE


Enhanced Entertainment: Tailors movie suggestions, contributing to a more enjoyable viewing experience.
Diverse Discovery: Expands viewers' cinematic exposure and encourages exploration.


Proposed Methodology
Dataset Used:- The dataset used in this work is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens. The Movie Details, Credits, and Keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/rounakbanik/movierecommender-systems/input) contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages. This dataset also has files containing 100,000 ratings from 700 users for a small subset of 9,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website



Techniques Used: 


- Content-Based Filtering: ➢ Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the characteristics or attributes of the items themselves. In a book recommendation system, this could involve analysing book descriptions, genres, authors, or other metadata. ➢ The system learns user preferences by matching the features of items with the user's historical preferences or explicit feedback. Collaborative Filtering (Model-Based): ➢ Model-based collaborative filtering involves creating an ML model based on the preferences of users and items. ➢ This method uses techniques like matrix factorization, clustering, or latent factor models to identify patterns and relationships between users and items. ➢ By analyzing user-item interactions, it predicts recommendations for users based on their similarities to other users or items in the system. Collaborative Filtering (Deep Learning): ➢ Collaborative filtering using deep learning involves employing neural networks to learn intricate patterns from user-item interactions. ➢ Deep learning models like neural collaborative filtering (NCF) use embeddings to represent users and items in a highdimensional space, enabling the network to capture complex relationships between users and items for more accurate recommendations.




Conclusions and Future Work


➢In conclusion we can say that the collaborative filtering using model based is performing the best among all the tested techniques. ➢But the results for the other techniques are not too far off. ➢Through the utilization of advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques, these systems can accurately predict user preferences and provide tailored recommendations. However, challenges such as the cold start problem, scalability, and ethical considerations remain pertinent. ➢From this we can conclude that even though one technique is giving a superior result, that doesn't mean it is definitely the best one as the other techniques were not too bad either. ➢In future more techniques can be tested together or a different dataset might give different result. That can be worked in the future. ➢ As we look to the future, integrating emerging technologies and addressing ethical concerns will be essential for ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of movie recommendation systems.

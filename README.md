Recommendation systems, often referred to as recommender systems, are a type of information filtering system that aim to predict a user's preference for a product or item. These systems are widely used in various domains such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media, and more to personalize user experiences and improve engagement. 
Content-based Filtering: Content-based filtering methods recommend items based on their attributes or features. These systems analyze the characteristics of items that a user has liked or interacted with and recommend other items with similar features. For example, if a user has watched and liked action movies, a content-based recommender might recommend other action movies to the user.
COLLABORATIVE FILTERING : To address some of the limitations of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B. Furthermore, the embeddings can be learned automatically, without relying on hand-engineering of features.

Recommender systems are sophisticated algorithms designed to provide product-relevant suggestions to users.

Recommender systems play a paramount role in enhancing user experiences on various online platforms, including e- commerce websites, streaming services, and social media.

The rise of platforms like Youtube, Netflix, Spotify, Amazon means we see recommendation systems everywhere online.

These systems are like smart tools that recommend things to users, such as movies, book, song or products, based on what each person likes.

Recommendation systems, often referred to as recommender systems, are a type of information filtering system that aim to predict a user's preference for a product or item. These systems are widely used in various domains such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media, and more to personalize user experiences and improve engagement. 
Content-based Filtering: Content-based filtering methods recommend items based on their attributes or features. These systems analyze the characteristics of items that a user has liked or interacted with and recommend other items with similar features. For example, if a user has watched and liked action movies, a content-based recommender might recommend other action movies to the user.
COLLABORATIVE FILTERING : To address some of the limitations of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B. Furthermore, the embeddings can be learned automatically, without relying on hand-engineering of features.
